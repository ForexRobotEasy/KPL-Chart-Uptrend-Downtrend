# KPL Chart Uptrend Downtrend Indicator ReadMe

## Description
The KPL Chart Uptrend Downtrend indicator is a custom indicator developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to identify and display uptrend and downtrend bars on a chart. The indicator uses specific logic to determine the presence of an uptrend or downtrend.

## Input Parameters
- AlertFrequency (default value: 1): Specifies the frequency of alerts in minutes.

## Global Variables
- trendColor: Stores the color value for trend bars.
- lastAlertTime: Tracks the time of the last alert triggered.

## Indicator Initialization
The OnInit() function is called during the initialization of the indicator. It sets up the indicator buffers and parameters. The indicator buffer is used to store the trend color values.

## Indicator Calculation
The OnCalculate() function is called for each bar to calculate the indicator values. It iterates through the bars and determines the presence of an uptrend or downtrend using the IsUptrend() and IsDowntrend() functions. The trend color is updated accordingly, and the indicator buffers are updated with the new trend color.

The function also checks if an alert needs to be triggered based on the AlertFrequency input parameter. If the alert frequency is greater than 0 and the current time is greater than the last alert time plus the alert frequency in minutes, an alert is triggered. The lastAlertTime variable is updated with the current time.

## Uptrend and Downtrend Logic
The IsUptrend() and IsDowntrend() functions are placeholders in the code and do not contain the actual logic to determine the presence of an uptrend or downtrend. These functions need to be customized by the user according to their specific requirements.
